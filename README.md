# GalacticPrime1
Hello and thank you for viewing my highschool capstone video game! Galactic Prime is a 2D Metroidvania that is currently using Unity
2019.2.11f1. In order to view the assets and code, you must download this version of Unity. If you're looking to just play and test
out the game, download the files in master. Once downloaded you can going into GalacticPrime/1.1Build and run the Galactic Prime
application (for the Windows platform).
